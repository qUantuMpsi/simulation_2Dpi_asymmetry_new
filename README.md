# simulation_2Dpi_asymmetry_new

This piece of code helps in simualting the 2Dpi data for asymmetry case, when we relax the assumption that c_s and c_i are not equal. For this I have assumed c_s = 1 and varied c_i in steps. The output provides simulated data for different epsilon values. 
This is a minutely modified code over simulation_2Dpi_asymmetry.py and about twice as fast as compared to the previous code.

Required packages:
1) Scipy
2) Numpy
3) Matplotlib
4) Numba
